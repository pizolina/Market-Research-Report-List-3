<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO Services</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO Services</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-support technique used in critical cases of heart and lung failure. VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO services support both the heart and lungs by extracting blood from a vein and returning it to an artery, acting as a temporary life-sustaining system. VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO services focus on just the lungs, removing blood from a vein and returning it to a vein after oxygenation. Both types of ECMO services play a vital role in stabilizing patients and providing the necessary support during life-threatening situations.</p></p>

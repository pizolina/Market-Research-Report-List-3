<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mud Terrain Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias-ply Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mud terrain tires can be classified into two main types: Radial Tires and Bias-ply Tires. Radial tires are constructed with crisscrossing layers of steel belts, providing better traction and durability on rough terrain. Bias-ply tires, on the other hand, have multiple layers of nylon cords crisscrossing at a 30-45 degree angle, making them more flexible and suitable for softer ground. Both types of tires are designed to enhance the performance and handling of vehicles in challenging off-road conditions.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant ABS Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardant ABS resin is available in two main types: non-halogen type and halogen type. Non-halogen type flame retardants do not contain halogen elements like bromine or chlorine, making them less toxic and more environmentally friendly. They work by forming char layers that block oxygen supply to the fire. On the other hand, halogen type flame retardants contain halogen elements and release corrosive gases when burning. They work by disrupting the combustion process. Both types are used in various industries to improve fire safety in products.</p></p>

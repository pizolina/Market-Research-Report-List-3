<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Cable Fault Locators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Short-Circuit</li><li>Earth Fault</li><li>Cable Breaks</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable cable fault locators are devices used to detect faults in electrical cables. There are different types of cable faults that can occur, including short-circuit, earth fault, cable breaks, and others. Short-circuit faults occur when there is an abnormal connection between two points in the cable, leading to a sudden increase in current flow. Earth faults happen when there is an unintentional connection between the live conductor and the ground. Cable breaks occur when there is a physical break or damage to the cable. Other types of faults may include insulation failures or water ingress.</p></p>

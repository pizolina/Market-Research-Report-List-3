<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Polysulfide Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Medium-Viscosity</li><li>High-Viscosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid polysulfide polymer is categorized into two main types based on its viscosity: medium-viscosity and high-viscosity. Medium-viscosity polymers have a lower thickness and flow more easily, making them ideal for applications requiring a more fluid consistency. On the other hand, high-viscosity polymers are thicker and provide a more rigid and stable structure, making them suitable for applications where a stronger bond or sealant is needed. Both types offer unique properties and are utilized in various industries depending on specific requirements.</p></p>

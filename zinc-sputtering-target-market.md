<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zinc Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zinc sputtering targets are available in two main types - rotary and non-rotatable. The rotary type is designed to rotate during the sputtering process, allowing for a more uniform coating and increased target utilization. On the other hand, non-rotatable targets are stationary during the sputtering process. Each type caters to different market needs, with rotary targets being more suitable for high-volume production and non-rotatable targets being commonly used for smaller-scale applications requiring precise coating control.</p></p>

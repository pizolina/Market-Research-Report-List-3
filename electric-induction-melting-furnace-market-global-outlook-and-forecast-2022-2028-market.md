<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Induction Melting Furnace Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2022-2028 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Core Induction Furnace</li><li>Coreless Induction Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electric Induction Melting Furnace Market refers to the market for furnaces that use electromagnetic induction to melt metal. It includes two types of furnaces: Core Induction Furnace and Coreless Induction Furnace. </p><p>Core Induction Furnace has a metal core that is surrounded by the heat resistant material. The metal core creates a magnetic field that induces currents in the metal being melted, causing it to heat up and melt.</p><p>On the other hand, Coreless Induction Furnace does not have a metal core. Instead, it uses a coil to create the magnetic field directly in the metal being melted, resulting in a more efficient and homogeneous melting process.</p><p>The market for these furnaces is expected to grow globally from 2022 to 2028, driven by the increasing demand for efficient and cost-effective metal melting processes in various industries.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sprayed Cement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Spraying</li><li>Wet Spraying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sprayed cement market can be divided into two types: dry spraying and wet spraying. Dry spraying involves mixing dry cement with water at the nozzle before being sprayed onto the surface. This method offers better control over the mixture and is commonly used for repair work. Wet spraying, on the other hand, involves pre-mixing cement with water before being sprayed onto the surface. This method is faster and used for larger and more complex projects. Both methods have their own advantages and are widely used in construction and mining industries.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear CMOS Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front Side Illuminated Linear CMOS Image Sensors</li><li>Back Side Illuminated Linear CMOS Image Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear CMOS image sensors are divided into two main types based on their structure and design: Front Side Illuminated (FSI) and Back Side Illuminated (BSI) sensors. FSI sensors have the photodiodes located on the top surface of the sensor, while BSI sensors have the photodiodes placed on the backside of the sensor. FSI sensors are more common and cost-effective, while BSI sensors offer higher sensitivity and better performance in low-light conditions. Both types cater to different market needs and applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Imaging Scopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging</li><li>Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal imaging scopes can be categorized into two main types: Un-cooled thermal imaging and Cryogenically cooled thermal imaging. </p><p>Un-cooled thermal imaging scopes use microbolometers to detect infrared radiation without the need for cooling. These scopes are generally smaller, lighter, and more affordable than their cryogenically cooled counterparts.</p><p>Cryogenically cooled thermal imaging scopes, on the other hand, use a cooling system to decrease the temperature of the sensor, resulting in higher resolution images with better sensitivity. However, these scopes tend to be larger, heavier, and more expensive.</p></p>

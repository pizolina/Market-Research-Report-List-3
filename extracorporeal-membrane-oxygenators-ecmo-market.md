<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenators (ECMO) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infant Paediatric Oxygenators</li><li>Adult Oxygenators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenators (ECMO) are devices used to provide cardiac and/or respiratory support to patients whose heart and lungs are not functioning properly. There are two main types of ECMO machines: Infant Paediatric Oxygenators and Adult Oxygenators. The Infant Paediatric Oxygenators are specially designed for smaller patients, while Adult Oxygenators are used for adult patients. Both types of devices work by oxygenating the blood outside the body and then pumping it back into the patient to support their heart and lung function.</p></p>

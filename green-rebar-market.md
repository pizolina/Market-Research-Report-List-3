<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Green Rebar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Green Rebar is a sustainable alternative to traditional steel rebar, with two main types available in the market: Deformed Steel and Mild Steel. Deformed Steel rebar is characterized by its ribbed surface which improves the bond with concrete, making it suitable for projects requiring higher tensile strength. Mild Steel rebar, on the other hand, is a more economical option with lower carbon content but is still durable and effective for construction projects. Both types contribute to reducing the environmental impact of construction by incorporating recycled materials.</p></p>

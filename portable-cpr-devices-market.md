<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable CPR Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual CPR Devices</li><li>Automated Mechanical CPR Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable CPR devices market is divided into two main types: manual CPR devices and automated mechanical CPR devices. Manual CPR devices require a person to perform chest compressions manually, following the recommended guidelines. These devices are typically lightweight, portable, and easy to use. On the other hand, automated mechanical CPR devices use a mechanical system that delivers chest compressions automatically, reducing the need for manual effort. These devices can provide consistent and effective compressions, even during prolonged resuscitation efforts. Both types aim to assist in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Based Thermal Conductive Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isotropic</li><li>Anisotropic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acrylic based thermal conductive adhesives come in two types - isotropic and anisotropic. Isotropic adhesives have uniform thermal conductivity in all directions, making them suitable for applications where heat needs to be dissipated evenly. On the other hand, anisotropic adhesives have varying thermal conductivity, allowing them to conduct heat more effectively in one direction than another. This property makes anisotropic adhesives ideal for applications where heat needs to be directed away from specific components.</p></p>

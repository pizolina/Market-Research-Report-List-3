<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hot Forging Lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Graphite-based Forging Lubricants</li><li>Non-Graphite-based Forging Lubricants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hot forging lubricants are used in the metalworking industry to reduce friction and wear during the forging process. Graphite-based forging lubricants contain graphite particles that provide excellent lubrication and heat resistance. Non-graphite-based forging lubricants, on the other hand, use alternative chemicals or materials to achieve similar lubrication properties. Both types of lubricants have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the forging operation. Graphite-based lubricants are known for their superior lubrication properties, while non-graphite-based lubricants may be preferred for certain applications due to environmental or performance considerations.</p></p>
